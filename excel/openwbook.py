# First, we would need to find out how many rows and columns the workbook has. 
# This can be achieved using .max_row and .max_column functions.

# Now, letâ€™s move to cell formatting.
# Cell formatting customizes the look of the cell in the workbook. 
# We would perform simple formatting on our loaded test workbook. 
# But, first, we would create a worksheet object.

Wb = your_workbook2['Products']

# Then, we would import PatternFill.
# Pattern Fill allows us to change the colour and pattern of the cells. 
# To define our PatternFill, we need to pass a pattern type and fgColor, which is a hex code.

# Since we are changing the workbook, we have to save it once done running our code. 
# So now, take a look at the spreadsheet. You will see the changes have been made to cell B7.
# To save the spreadsheet, use .save() function:

your_workbook2.save(filename='Test.xlsx')
